In this thesis, we deal with the automatic control of web browsers. Our aim is to create a~solution to record actions that can be saved and re-executed. As there is already a~number of such products, especially for the established Selenium framework, it is crucial for us to use the newer and modern Puppeteer library for which these tools do not exist. The thesis begins with the research part of libraries and products, then the requirements for our solution are determined, which include remote browser connection and user interface. The solution was implemented according to these requirements. Part of the thesis involves evaluating and comparing functionality with competing products. We can briefly evaluate---the advantage of our solution over Selenium IDE and Katalon Recorder products built on Selenium is the ability to connect to a~remote instance of a~browser. The drawback is the lack of support for conditions and cycles that were not determined as a~requirement, and, therefore, have not been implemented.
